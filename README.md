# Building a Neural Network with PyTorch
April 8, 2021

*"Hands-On with CSE"*

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks that are intended to be a brief introduction to using PyTorch and creating neural networks with the library.  These discuss the autogradient feature, optimization routines, the neural network helper classes, data loading, and also provide a few example neural network implementations.

This is based off of Matt West's previous PyTorch seminar: https://github.com/compdyn/pytorch_tutorial.
